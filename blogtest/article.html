				<h1>Meeting Nottingham's Chinese community</h1>

				<h2>
				As a university student, you can often feel disconnected from the city you’re studying in - and especially from the locals, particularly if they have a strong accent, or your only experience of them is from nightclubs.
				</h2>

				<p>
				But unlike others, I decided to actively engage with my local community. While many students obliviously walk on by while getting hammered at nightclubs every night, many locals can’t even dream of affording a night out, let alone sending kids to university or even getting a well-paid job.
				</p>

				<p>
				Nottingham is well-known for its deprivation, known as “Britain’s poorest city”, and it’s a situation which is getting worse not better. There are also many visible signs of deprivation here, like the many beggars in town, the smells of drugs wafting from council estates, and the people you see sometimes, standing and staring out of their front doors in the middle of the day.
				</p>

				<p>
				I couldn’t go on living here without making at least some attempt to help the community, and after breaking free from the drunken, loud (and quite middle class) university halls of first year, I decided to volunteer after moving to a house with 6 friends for 2nd year. (How are we coping? Don’t ask about the dishes….)
				</p>

				<p>
				I decided to volunteer with the NCWA - Nottingham Chinese Welfare Association, a charity providing social activities and community for local Chinese people. It may seem a weird choice, but the integration problems in the British Chinese community are well known, and elderly Chinese are even more likely to be isolated that what is already a section of society infamous for isolation. Also, as someone who is a quarter Chinese, and learning Mandarin, I thought it’d be a good way to keep up the language, and have some kind of connection to my roots.
				</p>

				<p>
				Charities like NCWA play a key role in their member’s mental health, but also in their life quality - with a huge variety of people and backgrounds, and daily activities ranging from cooking, to my IT lessons, to tai chi, you can’t help but get taken in by the positive energy of the place once you step in the door.
				</p>

				<p>
				My three to four months so far with the charity have been genuinely incredible. 
				Despite the age and skills gap between me, a Computer Science student, and my students, elderly people who are new to technology, I’ve really felt a connection to the people who I’ve met at NCWA.
				</p>

				<p>
				It’s a funny dynamic we all have - while I wouldn’t call anyone at the charity a friend, I really enjoy spending my time with the happy and bubbly people I volunteer with, and the interesting people who come to get my help when I turn up.
				</p>

				<p>
				This came to a head at last year’s Christmas party, where we all played silly games, I made a fool of myself attempting tai chi, and we sat back and reflected on what’s been a good year for them, and an amazing couple of months for me.
				</p>

				<p>
				Of course, Liz, the head of the charity, isn’t ignorant of what students want out of volunteer work, and was quick to help another volunteer when she said she was going to try applying to jobs in Asia, by asking people she knew if they could help. 
				</p>

				<p>
				Similarly, knowing I wanted to improve my Chinese, she gave me a copy of their basic guide to Cantonese, and invited me to their weekly lessons - not all Chinese can speak it, and to help community cohesion the charity offers lessons to its members.
				</p>

				<p>
				They’re small gestures, but really go to show the kindness and desire to improve people’s lives, that the people at the charity have. (Whether it’s lives of its members or even of volunteers like me). Because of all this, I’ll really miss the place when I move out of town for a work placement next year, and especially when I finally leave Nottingham once my degree’s over.
				</p>

				<p>
				Who knew? That the biggest pull factor to a city wouldn’t be high salaries  or vibrant city life - but a handful of OAPs in a small room at a community centre. That’s the power of the human spirit.
