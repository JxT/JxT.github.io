(How are we coping? Don’t ask about the dishes….)</p><figure data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="853" class="tmblr-full"><img src="http://67.media.tumblr.com/fa84f48d1449096653afd8991c1538df/tumblr_inline_o1qt9hamXJ1tsqvqt_500.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="1280" data-orig-height="853" width="500" height="333"></figure><blockquote><p>St. Anns is one of the UK’s poorest areas, and was even the subject of<a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nottinghampost.com%2FPrince-Harry-takes-seat-Nottingham-cinema-St-Ann%2Fstory-25967152-detail%2Fstory.html&amp;t=M2QwNzBhYmY4MWNkYzI0NGE5NWJhZjAyNmExNzhhMzAxYTc3YWJhZSx5UTFnTlZKaA%3D%3D" target="_blank"> a film supported by Prince Harry</a></p></blockquote><p>I ended up joining NCWA, the Nottingham Chinese Welfare Association, which provides social activities and a community for local Chinese people. I was interested since I’m a quarter Chinese, and thought it’d be a good way to get into my roots, and seeing how few people from the University had applied, I jumped on the chance.</p><h2>Not only that, but the <a href="http://t.umblr.com/redirect?z=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theguardian.com%2Fworld%2F2005%2Foct%2F19%2Fchina.race&amp;t=NzNmNWQ1NmNjNDFjNmY2MmY2MmZmY2Y5NDRmNDA2YTk2Nzg5Y2ZjMCx5UTFnTlZKaA%3D%3D" target="_blank">integration problems in the British Chinese community</a> are well known, and elderly Chinese are even more likely to be isolated that what is already a section of society infamous for isolation. Add this to minorities’ increased risk of poor health, and it makes a bleak picture.</h2><p>Charities like NCWA play a key role in their member’s mental health, but also in their life quality - with a huge variety of people and backgrounds, and daily activities ranging from cooking, to my IT lessons, to tai chi, you can’t help but get taken in by the positive energy of the place once you step in the door.</p><p>And despite the age and skills gap between me, a Computer Science student, and my students, elderly people who are new to technology, I’ve really felt a connection to the people who I’ve met at NCWA.</p><h2>It’s a funny dynamic we all have - while I wouldn’t call anyone at the charity a friend, I really enjoy spending my time with the happy and bubbly people I volunteer with, and the interesting people who come to get my help when I turn up.</h2><p>This came to a head at last year’s Christmas party, where we all played silly games, I made a fool of myself attempting tai chi, and we sat back and reflected on what’s been a good year for them, and an amazing couple of months for me.</p><p>Of course, Liz, the head of the charity, isn’t ignorant of what students want out of volunteer work, and knowing I wanted to learn more Chinese, she gave me a copy of the charity’s own basic guide to Cantonese, and invited me to their weekly lessons for free, waiving their usual member fee.</p><h2>It’s a small gesture, but really goes to show the kindness and desire to improve people’s lives that the charity inspires. (Regardless of whether it’s the lives of its members or even of volunteers like me!).</h2><p>Because of all this, I’ll really miss the place when I move out of town for a work placement next year, and especially when I finally leave Nottingham once my degree’s over.</p><p>Who knew? That the biggest pull factor to a city wouldn’t be high salaries &nbsp;or vibrant city life - but a handful of OAPs in a small room at a community centre. That’s the power of the human spirit.</p>
